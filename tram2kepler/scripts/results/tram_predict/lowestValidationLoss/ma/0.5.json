In this campaign, the suspected Russian threat actors use several highly obfuscated and under-development custom loaders to infect those involved in the cryptocurrency industry with the Enigma Stealer (detected as TrojanSpy.MSIL.ENIGMASTEALER.YXDBC), a modi\u0000ed version of the Stealerium information stealer. In addition to these loaders, the attacker also exploits CVE-2015-2291, an Intel driver vulnerability, to load a malicious driver designed to reduce the token integrity of Microsoft Defender. \ue90a Cookies Settings This website uses cookies for website functionality, tra\u0000c analytics, personalization, social media functionality and Steadavleerrtiisuinmg., O tuhre C ooorkiigei nNoatli cien pfororvmideast imoonr es itnefoarlmeart iwonh aicnhd serves as the base for Accept explains how to amend your cookie settings.
